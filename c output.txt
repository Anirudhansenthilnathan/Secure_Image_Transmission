1)
far,huge near pointers.
 datatype name vname - eg: int far *s1;
far,huge - 4 bytes
near - 2 bytes

2)
extern - extends the visibility of a variable and function in c.
usd when a particular variable need to accessed from another file

When we write extern some_data_type some_variable_name;  no memory is allocated. Only the property of the variable is announced.

Multiple declarations of extern variable is allowed within the file. This is not the case with automatic variables.

A variable or function can be declared any number of times, but it can be defined only once. (extern cases only)

we saw that the extern keyword was present implicitly. But this isnâ€™t the case with variables. If it were, memory would never be allocated for them.

Header file (globals.h)
// Declaration
extern int globalVar;


Source file 1 (file1.c)
#include "globals.h"

// Definition
int globalVar = 10;


Source file 2 (file2.c)
#include "globals.h"

void someFunction() {
    globalVar = 20; // Using the variable
}
